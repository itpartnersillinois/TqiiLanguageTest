<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Welcome to Training Qualified Interpreters (TQII) Language Test. The test is designed to evaluate your abilities to speak and comprehend oral and written English. The TQII Language test has three modules and all items within each module are timed. The first module is "Sentence Repetition", the second module is "Integrated Speaking", and the third module is "Interactive Reading."</p>
